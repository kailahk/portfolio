            Hi, I'm Kailah Korsh, a full stack web developer living in Los Angeles, CA.
            <br><br>
            I learned to code because I thrive in environments where I am empowered to think creatively, investigate
            curiosities, and deep dive into how and why things work the way they do. I love project-based work where I
            can collaborate with a team and punch above my weight to help achieve a shared goal, whether that is to
            build an entire application or a minor functionality. I gained many transferable skills working in the
            entertainment industry for a number of years, including organization, communication, time management, and
            creative problem solving, which compliment my technical strengths and give me a unique mindset with which to
            approach web development. I am passionate about bringing my work ethic, enthusiasm for continued learning,
            and coding skills to a company that has a mission I believe in.
            <br><br>
            Before I became a web developer, I worked in the music industry in artist management, where I assisted the
            managers of Harry Styles, Nicki Minaj, Meghan Trainor, and Ava Max. Most recently, I worked at
            celebrity-focused venture advisory firm, PLUS Capital, where the team works closely with artists and
            athletes to facilitate partnerships between celebrities and mission-driven companies where there is an
            aligned vision to inspire change.
            <br><br>
            At PLUS, I was exposed to the world of startups. I learned about companies in every industry that are using
            technology to innovatively approach topics I am passionate about, such as sustainability, mental health,
            diversity, equity, and inclusion, and the future of work and education. I realized that I was craving more
            structure in my professional life, and wanted a hard skill that I could rely on. I started using online
            resources to learn to code and found myself enthralled, challenged, and energized by the material. I began
            to feel more like myself, allowing both the logical and creative parts of my brain to not only coexist but
            empower one another. I completed General Assembly’s 12 week Software Engineering Immersive program, and I am
            now ready to dive into full time employment and continue my coding journey.
