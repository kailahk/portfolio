            Hi, I'm Kailah Korsh (She/Her), a full stack software engineer based in Los Angeles, CA and raised in Boston, MA.
<br><br>
I've always been drawn to creative problem-solving, and I discovered my love for coding when I realized it gave me the power to create something from scratch and bring my ideas to life. As someone who enjoys collaborating with others, I find project-based work to be the most fulfilling because I can contribute my unique strengths and learn from my team members.
<br><br>
Before transitioning to software engineering, I worked in the entertainment industry, which gave me valuable skills such as organization, communication, and creative thinking. I found myself drawn to the world of startups while working at PLUS Capital, where I was exposed to innovative companies using technology to tackle issues I care about, such as sustainability, mental health, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.
<br><br>
My experience at PLUS Capital motivated me to pursue a hard skill, and I discovered my passion for coding. I completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program, which gave me a solid foundation in full stack development.
<br><br>
As a software engineer, I'm excited to continue learning and growing while bringing my skills to a company with a mission I believe in. I'm passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on the world, and I'm committed to collaborating with others to achieve that goal.
