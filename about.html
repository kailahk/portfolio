            Hi, I'm Kailah Korsh, a software engineer living in Los Angeles, CA.
            <br><br>
            I learned to code because I thrive when I'm empowered to think creatively, investigate my
            curiosities, and dive deep into understanding why and how things work. I enjoy project-based work where I
            can collaborate on a team and punch above my weight to help achieve a shared goal, whether that goal is to
            build an entire application or a minor functionality. Before becoming an engineer, I gained many transferable skills working in the
            entertainment industry, including organization, communication, time management, and
            creative problem solving, which compliment my technical strengths and give me a unique mindset with which to
            approach web development. I am passionate about bringing my work ethic, enthusiasm for continued learning,
            and coding skills to a company that has a mission I believe in.
            <br><br>
            Before discovering my love of coding, I worked in artist management in the music industry, where I assisted the
            managers of Harry Styles, Nicki Minaj, Meghan Trainor, and Ava Max. Most recently, I worked at
            celebrity-focused venture advisory firm, PLUS Capital, where the team works closely with artists and
            athletes to facilitate partnerships between celebrities and mission-driven companies where there is an
            aligned vision to inspire change.
            <br><br>
            At PLUS, I was exposed to the world of startups. I learned about companies in every industry that are using
            technology to innovatively approach topics I am passionate about, such as sustainability, mental health,
            diversity, equity, and inclusion, the future of work and education, and the intersection of media and tech. I learned how to thrive on a small team in a fast-paced environment, own projects from concept to delivery, and work cross-functionally with my teammates. I realized that I was craving more
            structure in my professional life and wanted a hard skill that I could rely on. I started using online
            resources to learn to code and found myself enthralled, challenged, and energized by the material. I began
            to feel more like myself, allowing both the logical and creative parts of my brain to not only coexist but
            empower one another. I completed General Assemblyâ€™s 12 week Software Engineering Immersive program, and I am
            now ready to dive into full time employment and continue my coding journey.
