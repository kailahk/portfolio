            Hi, I'm Kailah Korsh (She/Her), a full stack software engineer based in Los Angeles, CA.
<br><br>
I discovered my love of coding when I realized it gave me the power to create something from scratch and bring my ideas to life by tapping into my creative side just as much as my organized, detail-oriented side. I thrive when I am empowered to think creatively, investigate my curiosities, and dive deep into understanding why and how things work.
<br><br>
My journey to becoming a software engineer has been shaped by my diverse range of passions and experiences. With a deep love for music, a background in Sociology, and hands-on experience in the entertainment industry, I bring a unique perspective to engineering. I am fascinated by the intersection of music and technology and believe that technology can play a pivotal role in making music more accessible and inclusive.
<br><br>
Before transitioning to software engineering, I gained valuable skills in organization, communication, and creative thinking while working in the entertainment industry. It was during this time that I was exposed to the world of startups and tech companies, witnessing their innovative approaches to other topics I am passionate about, such as sustainability, mental health, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.
<br><br>
Motivated by my experiences, I decided to pursue coding as a hard skill and completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program, equipping myself with a solid foundation in full stack development.
<br><br>
As a software engineer, I am driven by the desire to continuously learn and grow, while using my skills to contribute to a company with a mission that aligns with my values. I am passionate about leveraging technology to create positive change in the world. Collaboration is at the heart of my work, and I am excited to join forces with others to make a meaningful impact through technology.
